*If you wish to use this guide to rip assets out of the game and use them for your own benefit and not to mod, kindly **piss off***

This is a port of the steam guide with more detail and better formatting. This guide is intended to be for the benefit of other modding communities as well 

(*Unfortunately Blue Fire doesn't have a big enough modding scene to fascilitate a guide this detailed anyway*)

### [Core UE4 Modding Concepts](./Concepts.md)

### The Basics
 - [Decompressing the pak](./The%20Basics/Unpaking/)
 - [Using UEViewer (Umodel) to view and extract assets](./The%20Basics/UEViewer/)
 - [Configuration and packaging in engine](./The%20Basics/Engine/) (example given is for UI or textures)
 - [Final Paking](./Blue-Fire-Modding-Guide/The%20Basics/Paking/)
 
### Specific mod guides
 - [Replacing models](./Specific%20Guides/Models/)
 - [Disabling objects](./Specific%20Guides/Disabling/)
 - [Editing materials](./Specific%20Guides/Materials/)
 - [Text and Dialogue](./Specific%20Guides/Dialogue/)
 - [Replacing levels](./Specific%20Guides/Levels/) (custom maps)-this is thankfully obsolete for blue fire due to the awesome official [void maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1793350/Blue_Fire_Void_Maker/)!
 ### Uasset Editing
  - [Using UassetGUI](./Uasset%20Editing/UAssetGUI/)
  - [Using UassetAPI](./Uasset%20Editing/UAssetAPI/)
 
***^ All of these can be used in conjunction with each other in the same pak so feel free to experiment!***
 - [Blueprint modding](./Logic%20Mods/BluePrint/)
