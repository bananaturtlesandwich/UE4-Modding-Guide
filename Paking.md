# Final Paking

- Go into the folder where you packaged your mod and copy the Content folder in WindowsNoEditor\\ProjectName into a new folder which your mod will be contained in.
- Now recreate the folder structure outside of content that was seen in Umodel (In Blue Fire's case a folder called Blue Fire)
- Folder structure is very important for UE4 modding so make sure spellings of the folders are the same as they were when exported
- Download [unrealpak](https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/Blue-Fire-Modding-Guide/blob/main/Tools/UnrealPak.zip) by FluffyQuack and drag the mod folder onto UnrealPak-with-compression.bat

This will create a pak file. Rename the pak file with a _P at the end(so the game recognises it as a patch) and create a folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blue Fire\Blue Fire\Content\Paks\~mods ,place the pak file in it and run Blue Fire to see if it worked. Hopefully you should find it did.
