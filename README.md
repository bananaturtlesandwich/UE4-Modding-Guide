# Blue Fire Modding
This is a port of the steam guide with more detail and better formatting. This guide is intended to be for the benefit of other modding communities as well (Blue Fire doesn't have a big enough modding scene to fascilitate this anyway)

**Tools and resources can be found at the bottom**

### The Basics
 - [Decompressing the pak](./Unpaking.md)
 - [Using UEViewer (Umodel) to view and extract assets](./UEViewer.md)
 - [Configuration and packaging in engine](./Engine.md) (example given is for UI or textures)
 - [Final Paking](./Paking.md)
 
### Specific mod guides
 - [Replacing models](./Models.md)
 - [Disabling objects](./Disabling.md)
 - [Editing materials](./Materials.md)
 - [Text and Dialogue](./Dialogue.md)
 - [Replacing levels](./Levels.md) (custom maps)-this is thankfully obsolete for blue fire due to the awesome official [void maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1793350/Blue_Fire_Void_Maker/)!
 - [Using UassetGUI](./UAssetGUI.md)
 - [Using UassetAPI](./UAssetAPI.md)
 
***^ All of these can be used in conjunction with each other in the same pak so feel free to experiment!***
 - [Blueprint modding](./BluePrint.md)
# Tools and Resources
 ### General modding  
  - [Umodel](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel) by [Gildor](https://github.com/gildor2) for The viewing and export of game assets
  - [Epic Games launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download) by Epic Games where you can download Unreal Engine
  - [UnrealPak scripts](./Tools/UnrealPak.zip) By [Fluffyquack](https://github.com/FluffyQuack) used for final paking
 
 ### Models
  - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) by the [Blender foundation](https://github.com/blender) for 3d modelling
  - [PSK and PSA importer](https://github.com/Befzz/blender3d_import_psk_psa) by [Befzz](https://github.com/Befzz) for importing exported meshes and armatures
  
 ### Code/Uasset editing
  - [Fmodel](https://fmodel.app/) by Jet Brains in an alternative to umodel that is stronger than umodel with more text based formats (this may change because fmodel receives regular updates)
  - [UassetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) is an API that can read and modify UE4 game assets via C# scripting
  - [UassetGUI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) is a thin wrapper of UassetAPI with a user interface which is more user friendly than coding with uassetAPI 
  - [Heilos's](https://github.com/kaiheilos) [Asset editor](https://github.com/kaiheilos/Utilities) is an alternative to UassetGUI
  - [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) is a free hex editor that allows viewing, editing and searching through unreal engine assets
### Dialogue/Translation
  - [.locres text tool](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775093920915914794/836699867920859207/unreal_locres_texttool.exe) is a tool that allows complete editing of a localisation file
  - [Kein's serialiser](Tools/UAssetSerialiser.zip) which of which use in blue fire is limited to stringtables (*[dotnet 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-3.0.0-preview8-windows-x64-installer) is needed for this*). For use reference [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krHKG9T77cfRmIQ90k4H-fy9Vm6vVm8zR6oKAlgDiww/edit)
### Blueprint modding
  - The [Unreal Modloader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader) is a program by [RusselJ]() that allows injection of custom blueprints at runtime
  - [DRG Parser](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/DRG-Modding/tree/main/DRGParser) allows parsing of uasset and uexps to make dummying easier

# Guides
  - My [steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564366174) on Blue Fire modding which some sections were copied from (formatting is horrible)

  - [Buckminsterfullerene's](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02) BP tutorials for DRG - relevant from 3 onwards
  - [DRG modding](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/DRG-Modding/) is a collection of DRG guides and tools by [Buckminsterfullerene](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02)
