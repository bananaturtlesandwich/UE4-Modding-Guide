# Pak Decompression Options

**Keep in mind that there are more options found in [Pakers/Unpakers](../../Tools/Pakers.md) and [Pak Explorers](../../Tools/Pak-Explorers.md)**

- The following section illustrates a few different options for unpacking a pak archive for your game
- This section doesn't have to be done sequentially
- Your game's Paks folder should be located in your game's content folder
    - If this folder doesn't exist or there is no pak files to unpack and only raw assets then you can completely skip this section
    - If there are multiple pak files then your game has split its paks into chunks - This shouldn't affect the process significantly
