***Note that UModel has many more features than viewing and exporting, e.g showing related assets and toggling certain views - see them all using the dropdowns and by pressing H to see the keybinds***

# UEViewer/umodel

- Install [umodel](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel) by Gildor

- For proper structure, extract assets with [QuickBMS](QuickBMS.md) or [with UnrealPak](UnrealPak.md), however you can open the pak directly with umodel by right-clicking and selecting open with... > umodel location/umodel.exe

- You can explore the game files and find something you want to replace or modify. Open a package by double clicking it. You should get a pop-up asking for the version of the package - enter your game's version

- Find a package you would like to replace and view it. ctrl + x to export or export by using the tools pop-down. (here are my export preferences)
