# The Basics
This section walks you through the basic creation of a patch mod which includes unpaking of the game's pak file, engine setup and packaging and installation of content

You will need to know:
- The file path to your game (if on steam go to your game in your library and navigate to Properties>Local Files>Browse)
- The file path to your game's executable (`Game name/Binaries/Win64`)
- The file path to your game's pak file (`Game name/Content/Paks`)
- the version of unreal your game uses (right-click the .exe in and select properties - the version is this)
