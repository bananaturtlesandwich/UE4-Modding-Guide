# AES Keys
- If you have directed here then your pak file is encrypted using an AES key

- You can check this using [AESkeyFinder](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=9407&start=20)

- Copy your game's executable into the folder you installed the program

- Run the RUN Find 256-bit UE4 AES Key.bat file

- Copy the generated key into the prompt you were given

- The pak should now be able to be opened

- If not try another key if more were generated
