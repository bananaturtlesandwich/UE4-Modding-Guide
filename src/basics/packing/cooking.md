# Cooking
You can cook the assets in 2 ways:

either:

- Navigate to File > package project > Windows(64-bit)
- Select the folder you want to cook the mod into

or:

- Navigate to File > Cook Content For Windows
- It will output to the Saved/Cooked folder

The first time it will take quite long to build as it is compiling shaders
