# Auto Injector setup
- Out of the box, the modloader comes with an auto-injector (instructions are in the README but I'll explain here anyway)

- Open the ModLoaderInfo.ini and edit the path to where your modloader dll is stored

- Copy all the files(README isn't needed) to where the game binary is stored (in `Game store/Game name/Game project name/Binaries/Win64`)

- Run the binary and the modloader should hopefully auto-inject into the process
