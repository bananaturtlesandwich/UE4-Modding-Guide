# .profile creation

- To set up the .profile file, you will need to know 2 things: the name of the game binary located in `Game store/Game name/Game project name/Binaries/Win64` and the version of unreal engine the game runs on 
(**found by hovering your mouse over the same binary and looking at the version number**)

- Copy the BasicExampleGame.profile and rename it to the name of your game binary
- Then set the values according to the instructions using the UE4 version of your game (1 is true and 0 is false)
- Hopefully the signatures UML uses work for your game - if not then you will need to reverse engineer the game (for help consult [Russel's Exclusive Disco Club](https://discord.gg/ErTzBGtAUn))
- Share the new .profile to the `#profiles` channel in [Russel's Exclusive Disco Club](https://discord.gg/ErTzBGtAUn) so that other's won't have to go through this process
