# Dialogue

This guide will cover using the [.locres text tool](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775093920915914794/836699867920859207/unreal_locres_texttool.exe)

**These mods have major compatibility issues but replacement mods in general do**

- Run the executable and select a .locres file extracted from the `Localization` folder
- This is a raw asset so no need to specifically use umodel or fmodel
- This will generate a .txt containing all of the dialogue in the game
- Make any changes you wish 
- Once you are done convert the .txt back to .locres using the executable
- Pack the file with the right file structure and your changes will be saved
