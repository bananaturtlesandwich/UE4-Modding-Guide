***These mods have major compatibility issues but replacement mods in general do anyway***
If the text you want to modify is not contained in these you will have to use the [.locres text tool](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775093920915914794/836699867920859207/unreal_locres_texttool.exe)

- Run the executable and select the .locres file located in localisation
- This will generate a .txt containing all of the dialogue in the game
- Make any changes you wish 
- Once you are done convert the .txt back to .locres using the executable
- Pack the file with the right file structure and your changes will be saved
