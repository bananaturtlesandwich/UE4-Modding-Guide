# Asset Editors
These are tools able to parse and edit cooked .uasset and .umap files

  - [UAssetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) is an API that can read and modify UE4 game assets via C# scripting and reversible .json export - is brilliant for large scale edits or automation
  - [UAssetGUI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) is more friendly than coding with uassetAPI due its interface (also has dark mode :p)
  - [Heilos's](https://github.com/kaiheilos) [Asset editor](https://github.com/kaiheilos/Utilities) is an alternative to UAssetGUI
  - [DAUM](https://github.com/DarthPointer/DAUM) by [Drillboy Jenkins](https://github.com/DarthPointer) is a CLI program written using UAssetAPI with a lot of flexibility
  - [DRGEditor](https://github.com/craigmc08/drg-editor) by [craigmc08](https://github.com/craigmc08) is another alternative that is more specific to Deep Rock Galactic
