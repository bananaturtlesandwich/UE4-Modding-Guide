# Pak Explorers
These are tools capable of parsing a game's pak file and allowing the display and export of game files contained inside

- [Umodel](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel) by [Gildor](https://github.com/gildor2) is the most reliable and fast, allowing loading of both loose and paked files as well as a command line

- [Fmodel](https://fmodel.app/) by the fmodel team allows more extensive support for certain formats such as sound files and allows export of (irreversibly) json-serialised assets - also has more customisation options

- [UnrealPakViewer](https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/UnrealPakViewer) by [jashking](https://github.com/jashking) allows powerful filtering of pak file contents however can only export to json and csv (linked to my repo for now as I'm waiting for my pull request for the guide translation to be accepted)
