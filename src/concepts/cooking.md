# Cooking
- Before being put in a pak file, assets undergo a process called cooking where the data used by the engine is stripped so only the data the game requires to run is in the final pak
- You cannot 'decook' content just as you cannot 'decook' a steak once grilled
- Cooked assets are not able to be edited in the engine as that data has been stripped however they can be edited through the use of [Asset Editors](../Tools/Asset-Editors.md)
- After editing they can still be put in a mod as these editors should handle binary equality for you
