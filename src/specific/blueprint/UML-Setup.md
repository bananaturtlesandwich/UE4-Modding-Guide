# UML setup

- We will use UML to inject custom actors to run blueprint (Unreal's visual scripting system)

- This allows addition of custom logic, events, etc.

- Download the [Universal Unreal Modloader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader/releases/) by [RusselJ](https://github.com/RussellJerome)

- This will contain a .exe, some .dlls and some .profile files in the profiles folder

- If your game does not have a .profile file contained in the release setup instructions to create one are [here](Profile.md) 

- Run the .exe and then run the game to check that everything works fine

- This should also generate a folder called `LogicMods` in Paks and a folder called `CoreMods` in Content
