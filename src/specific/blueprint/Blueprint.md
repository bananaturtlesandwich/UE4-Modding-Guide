# Blueprint mods

The following section details the creation of mods that use blueprints loaded in game to execute blueprint code

In this guide I use Unreal Mod Loader as the loader as it is the most accessible and general tool

However there are many other ways that blueprints can be loaded e.g via startup map, inheritance dummying, game-mode editing or level blueprint loading

But the mod creation part stays relatively the same - effectively the same as any content creation for an unreal engine 4 game with blueprints
